### Influenza Forecast

This repository provides the python code underlying the influenza wave classification problem as presented via the [forecasting webapp](https://influenzaforecast.herokuapp.com/). The three most import files of this repository are:
1. The InfluenzaForecastPy3.py module containing the code implementing the forecast and the visualizations.
2. The DataFormatting.py module in the Data folder providing the code to load and transform the data. 
3. The InfluenzaForecast.ipynb which was used to quickly explore and visualize the forecast and the influenza wave statistics. In addition, it provides a quick overview on the project and can be used to explore the code.
